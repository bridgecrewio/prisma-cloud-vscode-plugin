# VSCode Prisma Plugin
The Prisma Cloud plugin for Visual Studio Code leverages the capabilities of Prisma Cloud Application Security, a static code analysis tool designed specifically to scan code for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) issues and Secrets vulnerabilities.
By integrating the Prisma Cloud plugin into Visual Studio Code, developers receive real-time scan results and inline fix suggestions while developing code. You can download the plugin directly from the Visual Studio Code Plugin Marketplace.
